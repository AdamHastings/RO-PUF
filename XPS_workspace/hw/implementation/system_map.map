Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,862 out of  53,248    5%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             4,096 out of  53,248    7%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          3,196 out of  26,624   12%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   3,196 out of   3,196 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   3,196   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,457 out of  53,248    8%
    Number used as logic:             3,581
    Number used as a route-thru:        361
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     384
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     131

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
