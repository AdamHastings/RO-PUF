   "inverter" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc4vlx60, package ff668, speed -11
This design is using the default stepping level (major silicon revision) for
this device (1). Unless your design is targeted at devices of this stepping
level, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the stepping level of the
parts you will be using. This will allow the tools to take advantage of any
available performance and functional enhancements for this device. The latest
stepping level for this device is '2'. Additional information on "stepping
level" is available at support.xilinx.com.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,690 out of  53,248    5%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,942 out of  53,248    7%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,986 out of  26,624   11%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,986 out of   2,986 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,986   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       4,149 out of  53,248    7%
    Number used as logic:             3,427
