WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   ring_osc_0/ring_osc_0/USER_LOGIC_I/ring_osc[2] is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <dlmb_LMB_ABus[31]> is incomplete. The
   signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <dlmb_LMB_ABus[30]> is incomplete. The

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    6
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,159 out of  53,248    4%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,521 out of  53,248    6%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,492 out of  26,624    9%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,492 out of   2,492 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,492   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,635 out of  53,248    6%
    Number used as logic:             3,006

      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     131

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  Number of bonded IOBs:                  9 out of     448    2%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:               2 out of      32    6%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.85

Peak Memory Usage:  486 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  16 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   10 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
