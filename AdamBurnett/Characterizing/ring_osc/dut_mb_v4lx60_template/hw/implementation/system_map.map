Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    7
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,367 out of  53,248    4%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,794 out of  53,248    7%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,817 out of  26,624   10%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,817 out of   2,817 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,817   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,908 out of  53,248    7%
    Number used as logic:             3,279

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
