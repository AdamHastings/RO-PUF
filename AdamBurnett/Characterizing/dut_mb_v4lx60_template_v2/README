DUT_PPC_V4LX60_TEMPLATE_V2
==========================

<TODO> Update with your own design information.

Version 2: Adds a heartbeat output to the PUF Power Board and uses
granted/released acknowledgments to imporve the use of the UART in the
event of a reset or a reconfiguration.

The UART MicroBlaze Virtex4 LX60 Test is designed specifically to
verify the UART is correctly behaving between the DUT and the Power
Board.  This requires that the Power Board first be programmed with a
design that can turn on the DUT Board, but also muxes control from the
UART Tx/Rx pins to display the output from the DUT to Minicom.

The simple design for the DUT prints the typical "Hello World" string
to Minicom.  There really is nothing special about this design except
that the data/system.ucf constraints are setup for the I/O to the
headers on the DUT board to provide UART Tx/Rx to the Power Board.

This design uses the MicroBlaze, not the PowerPC.
