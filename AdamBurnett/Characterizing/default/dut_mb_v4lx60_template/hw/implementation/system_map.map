Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    5
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,530 out of  53,248    2%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,794 out of  53,248    5%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,911 out of  26,624    7%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,911 out of   1,911 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,911   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,906 out of  53,248    5%
    Number used as logic:             2,279
    Number used as a route-thru:        112

      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     131

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
